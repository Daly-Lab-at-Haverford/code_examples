# Overview

This is a short guide on using matplotlib to make publication quality plots. plot.ipynb is the true "guide", and the other two notebooks have good examples without very much commentary.

# Required Packages

* matplotlib
* jupyter 
* notebook
* psi4 is helpful but not required
* scipy is helpful but not required

These can be installed using conda:

`conda install -c conda-forge psi4 numpy scipy matplotlib jupyter notebook`

# Useful Links

* Matplotlib Documentation: https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/named_colors.html 

# Included Files

* Several Jupyter Notebooks showcasing effective plotting. 

# Possible Improvements

* Include some python scripts for plotting without using Jupyter Notebook.
